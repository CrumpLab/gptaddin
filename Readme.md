The purpose of this package is to create RStudio addins for interfacing with the OpenAI API through the `openai` R library. 

This is an experimental project that is under a short spurt of development for my personal use. 

I'm not encouraging anyone to install this package, but it could serve as a useful example for other people looking to customize their own writing assistant.

I'm blogging about the process of making this package here:
