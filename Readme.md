The purpose of this package is to create RStudio addins for interfacing with the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/) through the [openai R library](https://github.com/irudnyts/openai). 

The addins are intended to provide writing assistant functions, such as taking selected text and having a GPT model return suggested edits.

This is an experimental project that is under a short spurt of development for my personal use. 

I'm not encouraging anyone to install this package, but it could serve as a useful example for other people looking to customize their own writing assistant in RStudio.

I'm blogging about the process of making this package here:
