<p>Output:</p>
<p>Cats are a species of four-legged animals that are commonly kept as
pets by humans. They come in various breeds and can exhibit different
personalities and behaviors that make each one of them unique. They can
be aloof and independent or affectionate and playful, depending on their
upbringing and environment.</p>
<p>While most cats are known to have small appetites and prefer to
nibble on small amounts of food throughout the day, some may require
specific feeding times to maintain their health and energy levels. It is
not uncommon for a cat’s daily meals to be divided into several smaller
portions.</p>
<p>In the case of your cat, they appear to have two breakfasts a day as
part of their daily routine. It is important to ensure that your cat’s
dietary needs are met and that they have access to fresh water at all
times.</p>

<p>We show that theories of response scheduling for sequential action
can be discriminated on the basis of their predictions for the dynamic
range of response set activation during sequencing, which refers to the
momentary span of activation states for completed and to-be-completed
actions in a response set. In particular, theories allow that future
actions in a plan are partially activated, but differ with respect to
the width of the range, which refers to the number of future actions
that are partially activated. Similarly, theories differ on the width of
the range for recently completed actions that are assumed to be rapidly
deactivated or gradually deactivated in a passive fashion. We validate a
new typing task for measuring momentary activation states of actions
across a response set during action sequencing. Typists recruited from
Amazon Mechanical Turk copied a paragraph by responding to a “go” signal
that usually cued the next letter but sometimes cued a near-past or
future letter (n-3, n-2, n-1, 0, n-2, n-3). The activation states for
producing letters across go-signal positions can be inferred from RTs
and errors. In general, we found evidence of graded parallel activation
for future actions and rapid deactivation of more distal past
actions.</p>

<p>Explain how many cats it takes to wake someone up in the morning for
breakfast.</p>
<hr>
<p>Output:</p>
<p>The number of cats it takes to wake someone up in the morning for
breakfast can vary depending on the person’s sleep patterns, the
personality of the cats, and how loud or persistent they are in meowing
or purring for their food. In general, one or two cats may be enough to
wake someone up, especially if they are hungry and vocal. However, some
cats may be more subtle in their demands or may wait patiently for their
owner to wake up on their own. Ultimately, it depends on the individual
situation.</p>

<p>This function assigns a “helpful assistant” role at the system level.
This is a test to determine whether the role can be easily changed

other thing changes too. Got it?</p>

<h3 id="chat-with-memory">Chat with memory<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#chat-with-memory"></a>
</h3>
<p>The above functions send a single prompt with no context from any
previous prompt. As a result, chat-like behavior consisting of a
back-and-forth series of prompts is not implemented. The
<code><a href="../reference/start_chat.html">start_chat()</a></code> function and <code>continue_chat</code> addin
provide some of this functionality. These functions could be further
improved, especially for scoping purposes.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="start_chat">start_chat()<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#start_chat"></a>
</h4>
<p>This function sends a single prompt assigning the system role as a
helpful assistant. It is not an add-in, and the function runs from the
console. Running the function also creates a list object in the global
environment called <code>my_chat</code>. There are two lists inside that
keep track of the message history. <code>my_chat$message</code> is a
list of the message history. The message history grows as the chat
continues. However, there is no error-checking, such as ensuring that
token limits have not been reached.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="continue_chat">continue_chat()<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#continue_chat"></a>
</h4>
<p>This function is similar to <code>chat_to_doc</code>. To use it,
select the text in the editor, and then choose the
<code>continue_chat</code> add-in. The selected text gets appended to
the message history in <code>my_chat$message</code>. The whole message
history, including the newly added text, will serve as the prompt to
OpenAI. This will provide the context of the entire chat, enabling the
assistant to provide responses that depend on the previous chat.</p>
<p>Notes: I haven’t added any formatting to distinguish model responses
from my own text.</p>
<p>Future development notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try using the the larger context models (16k)</li>
<li>When the message history nears the prompt token limit, ask for a
summary of the entire chat, then use the summary of the chat as the seed
for a new chat. This should provide a larger range of somewhat
continuous chat like behavior.</li>

<p>I’m testing out the chat, what should we talk about?</p>
<p>Well, there are many interesting topics we could talk about! What are
some of your interests?</p>
<p>What are you interests, I’ll choose from those.</p>
<p>As an AI language model, I don’t have personal interests like humans,
but I can discuss a wide range of topics. For example, we could talk
about current events, technology, science, history, or even popular
culture. What do you think?</p>
<p>I think a lot of things.</p>
<p>That’s great! Is there anything in particular that you would like
help with?</p>
<p>How to think more things sometimes and less things other times. How
to be in control of the number of things I’m thinking about.</p>
<p>That’s a great question. One way to control the number of things
you’re thinking about is to practice mindfulness meditation. This
involves focusing your attention on your breath or an object, and when
your mind starts to wander, you simply bring your focus back to your
breath or object. This practice trains your brain to be more aware of
your thoughts and can help you let go of distractions and decrease the
number of things you’re thinking about.</p>
<p>Another useful technique is to organize your tasks and prioritize
them so that you focus on the most important ones first. This can help
you break down your to-do list into manageable chunks and reduce the
feeling of overwhelm. You could also try setting specific times
throughout the day to focus on certain tasks or thoughts, and then set
aside other times when you purposely avoid thinking about anything
work-related or distracting.</p>
<p>Remember, it’s important to find what works best for you and your
unique situation. Everyone has different strategies for managing their
thoughts, so don’t be afraid to experiment with different techniques
until you find what works best for you.</p>

<h3 id="gpt_edit">gpt_edit<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#gpt_edit"></a>
</h3>
<p>Note: I copied in the function I wrote and asked GPT to “Explain how
this R function works as an Rstudio addin so that someone else could use
it.”, and it produced roughly the text below with a few edits.</p>
<p>This is an R function called <code>gpt_edit</code> that allows the
user to edit a selected text using GPT-3. It is designed as an RStudio
addin, which means that it can only be used from within RStudio.</p>
<p>When the function is called, it first gets the selected text within
RStudio using <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioapi/reference/selections.html" class="external-link">rstudioapi::selectionGet()</a></code>. It then presents
the user with a menu to choose from three different editing prompts:
“Basic spelling and grammar”, “Flow, reduced word count”, or “Write
custom prompt”.</p>
<p>Depending on the user’s choice, the function sets a
<code>system_content</code> variable to a specific editing prompt. If
the user chooses option 3, they are prompted to enter their own custom
prompt.</p>
<p>After the user selects their editing prompt, the function makes an
API call to GPT-3 using the <code><a href="https://irudnyts.github.io/openai/reference/create_chat_completion.html" class="external-link">openai::create_chat_completion</a></code>
function. This sends the selected text along with the chosen editing
prompt to GPT-3 for editing.</p>
<p>Finally, the edited text is printed to the console using
<code>cat</code> and <code>print</code>. This allows the user to see the
edited text and make any necessary changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="write_function_doc">write_function_doc<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#write_function_doc"></a>

<p>Highlight an R function, then choose this addin and have GPT generate

especially as a starting point. Make sure to delete all of the stuff you
don’t want in your function documentation :)</p>

</h3>
<p><code><a href="../reference/run_grammar_checker.html">run_grammar_checker()</a></code> takes a file as an input, and
opens a shiny app. The document is parsed at the sentence or paragraph
level. A user can manually go through each piece of text and choose to
submit it to OpenAI. Very bare bones. This function will likely change.
I’m sharing it as an example, and will be modifying it for my own
use-cases.</p>
<p>At the same time, I’m starting to get very usable results!</p>
<p>Dev notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improved the display of visual differences. The API was returning
text with new line characters causing failure of difference detection in
the suggested text window. New line characters are now removed from the
suggested text.</p></li>
<li><p>Added some API model selection</p></li>
</ul>
<p>TO DO:</p>
<p>[x] - Add scroll bar to quickly move around document location.</p>
<p>[] - Allow document to be reparsed at sentence or paragraph level in
the app</p>
<p>[x] - set default parsing to paragraph, which seems to give better
results anyway.</p>
<p>[] - Allow sending a custom prompt</p>
<p>Currently the shiny app does not change the original document, and
any suggested changes need to be done manually by the user. I’m likely
to keep it this way for a while. Although I’m starting to get decent
results, the frequency of weird stuff is still high, and the whole
process needs supervision.</p>
<p>[] - take a closer look at tokenizer and reconstructing the original
document, consider what I want in terms of adding suggestions back into
the original document programmatically.</p>
<p>[x] - add a gpt-3.5-turbo option, which should perform similarly to
davinci at much less cost. The minor nuisance is that it frequently
reverts to being a chatbot…need to find a good prompt that minimizes
chatty responses.</p>
<p>[x] - set default model to gpt-3.5-turbo which is cheaper and good
enough.</p>
